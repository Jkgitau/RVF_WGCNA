This repository contain the pipeline, code for each analysis step, obtained results, and links to important resources required to develop the **Bos taurus gene co-expression network to understand the pathogenesis of Rift Valley Fever**  
The topics covered include;  

- What data you need for WGCNA
- How to perform network construction and module detection
- How to export the network files for visualization in Cytoscape
- Correlate the modules with external trait (discrete type)
- Correlate the modules with external trait (continuous type)
- Further investigation on particular module-trait relationship
- Visualization (e.g. scatterplot, bubble plot)
- Summary of the whole WGCNA analysis
